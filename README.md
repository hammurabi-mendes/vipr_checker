# VIPR checker using Satistiability Modulo Theories Library (SMT-LIB)

# Before compiling:

To adjust the files to your environment, modify `local_runner.sh` to update your working directory and the path to the SMT checker (we tested with [`cvc5`](https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5)).
```
-CVC=<cvc_path>
-DIRNAME=<working_directory>
+CVC=/home/myusername/bin/cvc5
+DIRNAME=/home/myusername/vipr_checker
```
Then, modify ``remote_execution_manager.cpp`` changing `<working_directory> with your path:
```
- "<working_directory>/local_runner.sh",
+ "/home/myusername/local_runner.sh",
```

In addition, still in ``remote_execution_manager.cpp``, change ``localhost`` with a list of machines available in your cluster, and the number of hardware cores available in each of them
```
- add_machine(string("localhost"), 8);
- add_machine(string("mymachine1"), 64);
+ add_machine(string("mymachine2"), 64);
...
+ add_machine(string("mymachineN"), 64);
```

If you are not running under Linux, please remove the ``-DLINUX`` flag in the ``Makefile``.

# After making changes, compile like this:

```
make clean;
make
```

# After compiling, run like this:

```
./run_one.sh dano3_3.vipr 50
```

Replace dano_3_3.vipr with whichever vipr file you want to check.
Replace 50 with the block size of your choice. If you prefer the tool to decide the block size based on the hardware parallelism, make block size ``0''.

**Note that the program will work only if you can access the machines specified in ``remote_execution_manager.cpp`` with ssh without a password, because thatâ€™s how we dispatch local and remote executions.**
